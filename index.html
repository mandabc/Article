        <p>Safura Salek, one-half of Los Angeles design collective Mass Studio, can always envision exactly what she wants for a space—and more often than not, it can't be found. So she does what she prefers to do anyway: She designs the detail, whether it be a kitchen island or a nightstand, from scratch. "You’re free to do what you want," she says of going custom. "You’re not restricted by size or material or how you’re applying those things and putting them together." As luck would have it, renovating this Los Angeles loft—a young, just-married couple's first home—required this very approach at almost every turn. 
          The unit was essentially a blank slate, a single, wide-open space with a small kitchen along one wall and a bathroom tucked away near the front door, both in need of an update.</p>

          <p>Since there were no walls in the loft, aside from those enclosing the bathroom, Safura's first task was to carve out a space for the bedroom. With the kitchen on the opposite side of the space, near the wall of steel windows, the only spot that worked was right next to the front door. Leaving the bed in plain sight wasn't an option (it would be the first thing guests saw upon arrival—no thanks), but neither was building full-on walls (they would block out the only source of natural light). For the best of both worlds, Safura chose to build a partial wall, with a Pac-Man–esque cutout, next to the door.</p>
