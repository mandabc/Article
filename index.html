                <p>Have you ever been stuck for hours obsessing over a font that matched your work? Before starting a project, do you already think about which font you will use? Do you get annoyed when you read an important message written in Comic Sans?
                     Or do you feel offended when a mundane sentence is written in all caps? Rest assured, you are not alone. </p>
                    <p>Architects and designers constantly use graphic elements as expressive means in the schematization of their works. 
                    Among them, the most common are the drawings, in a constant variety of techniques, styles, and patterns. But among the elements that make up the boards, panels and drawings, techniques and models, there is a particular fragment that helps them in composition and identity: the font.</p>

Types are the designs assumed by a particular family of letters in their pattern. Within the family, there are variations between the letters (light, italic and bold),
                   by the type of box (high - upper and lower - lowercase), by source classification, including Sans - serif (without serif), Serif (with serif), Script (cursive) and Dingbat (ornamental), in addition to numerous other identity features of the same. </p>
