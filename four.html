        <p>Since there were no walls in the loft, aside from those enclosing the bathroom, Safura's first task was to carve out a space for the bedroom.<br> With the kitchen on the opposite side <br>of the space, near the wall of steel windows, the only spot that worked was right next to the front door. Leaving the bed in plain sight wasn't an option (it would be the first thing guests saw upon arrival—no thanks), but neither was building full-on walls (they would block out the only source of natural light). For the best of both worlds, Safura chose <br>to build a partial wall, with a Pac-Man–esque cutout, next to the door.</p>
