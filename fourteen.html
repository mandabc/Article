                    <p>Custom details like these aren't Safura's only signature design moves. "I love creating what I like to call 'conversational pits or corners,'" she tells us. The massive concrete column in middle of the loft—it's an impressive 32 inches 
                            in diameter—was the perfect opportunity to make one. The designer used its obtrusiveness
                             to her advantage, wrapping a semicircular bench upholstered
                            in a buttery wool mohair—plus a matching, channel-tufted backrest—around the pillar to create an intimate secondary seating area facing the living room. "People 
                            can sit on their own and have a conversation, or they can sit and converse with people on the couch," she explains.</p>
